Use Vim along with your project git repository to have all project-oriented IDEs cool features.

Features
========
* Integrated with git at project-level repository
* Project explorer
* File outline
* Auto-completion
* Jump to methods, classes, functions... (definitions and uses of them) using keyboard or mouse
* Syntax checking and highlighting
* Project level search (git grep or cscope)
* Comment/uncomment lines quickly
* Easy system copy & paste (depends on clipboard, see [Requirements](#requirements))
* Keyboard and mouse mappings for common actions
* (Don't be scared by the time it takes the first time you open a project file, is gathering the project references and is only the first time)

By default the Vim-IDE mode is only automatically enabled when opening [supported languages](#fully-supported-languages) files, but it is easy to add more languages (read [Adding new languages](#adding-new-languages)" section for more info).

Usage
=====
You should run Vim from your project root directory, all /my/project/root files will be parsed to get the available tags.

    cd /my/project/root
    vim any/of/my/project/files.SUPPORTED-LANGUAGE

Only a [few usual vim customisations](https://github.com/dmonllao/vim-IDE/blob/master/.vimrc) are available when using Vim to open unsupported languages files.

Requirements
============
* Vim 7.3 and higher (not tested on lower versions)
* Ctags (or exhuberant Ctags) for project-scope tags, jump to definitions, auto-completion...
* For easy copy & paste to the system clipboard Vim should be compiled with **clipboard** support (vim-gtk package compiles Vim with clipboard support)
* For cscope support (list of tags uses) Vim should be compiled with **--enable-cscope** option (vim-gtk package compiles Vim with cscope support)

Install
=======

Backup your **~/.vimrc** and your **~/.vim** if you want

    mv ~/.vim ~/.vim.bak
    mkdir -p ~/.vim
    git clone git://github.com/dmonllao/vim-IDE.git ~/.vim
    ln -sf ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
    git -C ~/.vim submodule init
    git -C ~/.vim submodule update

(Optional) Copy/add your own **.vimrc** rules and overrides to **~/.vim/custom.vim**, more info in **~/.vim/custom.vim.dist**; note that your settings may conflict with the ones set by vim-IDE.

Fully supported languages
=========================

Mostly the ones I use:

* Shell
* PHP
* Javascript
* Vim
* Markdown
* Text
* HTML

Languages can be easily added, more info in next section. Feel free to contribute.

Adding new languages
====================
* Create the filetype specifics in **ftplugin/FILETYPENAME.vim**
* Add a line with "autocmd vimenter * IDEOpen" in your **ftplugin/FILETYPENAME.vim** to add IDE features
* Create a **fttags/FILETYPENAME.sh** to write the ctags command, use **fttags/template.sh** template

Commands
========
* **Auto-complete**: **\<Tab\>** in "Insert mode" while writing
* **Jump to methods, classes or functions**
    * **\<C-LeftMouse\>** over the method or class name to **jump to its definition**
    * **\<C-RightMouse\>** over the method or class name to **jump to its definition, splitting the window horizontally**
    * **\<C-MiddleMouse\>** over the method or class name to **jump to its definition, splitting the window vertically**
    * Cursor on the method or class and **\<C-c\>** to **open the definition splitting the window horizontally**
    * Cursor on the method or class and **\<C-f\>** to **open the definition splitting it vertically**
    * Cursor on the method or class and **\<C-a\>** to **open the definition on the current window**
    * Cursor on the method or class and **\<C-v\>** to **open a list of references to that tag**
* **Open a file from the project explorer**: **c** to open it splitting the screen horizontally, **f** vertically and **a** in the current window
* **To toggle the "File outline" visibility:** **\<F8\>**
* **To toggle the "Project explorer" visibility:** **\<F7\>**
* **Comment/uncomment the current line**: **\<leader\>c\<space\>** in non-Insert mode to comment/uncomment (\<leader\> key is mapped to "\" by default)
* **Comment/uncomment a bunch of lines**: **v** to enter in "Visual mode", select lines and **\<leader\>c<space>** to comment/uncomment them all
* **To paste without indentation problems**: **\<F9\>** and **\<C-S-P\>**
* **To copy**: Select the text using the mouse cursor or visual mode and **\<C-c\>** (only **if the system clipboard is available**)
